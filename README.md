# SenseDetector
This project features a simple web interface to display information about an Arduino-based sensor device, along with its 3D design files and hardware setup.

## Project Overview

The **SenseDetector** consists of an Arduino Uno R3, sensors (temperature, humidity, and fake radiation sensor), and LEDs. The goal is to monitor environmental factors like temperature and humidity, and provide visual feedback to the user using LEDs.
